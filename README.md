# Assignments for Data Structures and Algorithms
_Description of two assignments are given in each folder BTL1 and BTL2_
## Assignment 1: Building Concat_String using List
- Typically, string literals are implemented using an array list to store contiguous characters. However, if strings are stored that way, the operation
concatenate/join two strings of length m and n respectively has a complexity of O(m + n).

- On the other hand, a linked list is a data structure that can perform the join operation of 2 lists with less complexity.

- In this assignment, I am asked to implement a string class (which used linked list) that efficiently supports string concatenation using list data structures called ConcatStringList.

## Assignment 2: Building a Concat_String using Tree and Hash Structure
- The description is the same as in assignment 1, but you need to use Tree and Hash Structure to implement ConcatStringList.
